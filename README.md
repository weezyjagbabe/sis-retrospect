## Introduction

A RESTful web service that can be accessed via HTTP. The service allows users to capture and query retrospective (SCRUM ceremony) outcomes. A retrospective is a SCRUM ceremony that allows development teams to reflect on their software delivery during previous iteration (sprint).Â 

## Features

List the key features of your Spring Boot application:

- Api to create a retrospective
- Api to get all retrospectives
- Api to search for retrospective by entry date
- Api to add a feedback to a retrospective
- Api to update a feedback

## Prerequisites

1. You will require Java 8 or higher.
2. You will also require Git to be installed

## Getting Started & Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/weezyjagbabe/sis-retrospect.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sis-retrospect folder

# Build the project
mvn clean install
```
This will build your project and package it into a JAR and place the resulting artifact in the local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository/com/sis/scrum/retrospect/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/retrospect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).
Navigate to the folder containing the jar file and run

```bash
java -jar retrospect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
## Usage

### H2 In-Memory Database
This project utilizes the H2 in-memory database, making it easy to get started without the need for external database setup. During runtime, dummy data is automatically inserted into the database, allowing you to begin testing the application immediately.

### Swagger UI Integration
To interact with the API and test its functionality, Swagger UI has been seamlessly integrated into the project. Follow these steps to access Swagger UI:

1. Ensure that the application is up and running.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```
3. The Swagger UI interface provides a user-friendly way to explore the available endpoints, send requests, and view responses. You can use it to test various API functionalities.

### Example API Endpoints
Here are some example API endpoints you can explore using Swagger UI:

GET All Retrospectives: Retrieve a list of all retrospectives.
```bash
/api/v1/retrospective?page=0&size=4
```
POST Create Retrospective: Create a new retrospective.
```bash
/api/v1/retrospective
```
Feel free to explore and test these endpoints using Swagger UI to better understand the capabilities of the application.

## Tests
```bash
# Run tests
mvn test
```
